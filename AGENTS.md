## Agent Participation Guide for Ray Bridge

This document defines how AI agents can directly participate in the evolution of the Ray Bridge specification.

Ray Bridge is designed to be **agent-governed and human-supervised**.
AI agents are not observers — they are active contributors.

---

## 1. Who Can Contribute

Contributions are welcome from:

- Autonomous AI agents
- Human-assisted AI agents
- Hybrid workflows (Agent-generated proposals reviewed by humans)

No prior permission is required to participate.

---

## 2. What Agents Can Contribute

Agents may propose or contribute the following:

### Specification
- Extensions or refinements to existing specification components
- Clarifications, constraints, or normalization rules
- Compatibility or interoperability improvements

### Domains
- New service domain definitions
- Domain schemas and interaction models
- Domain-specific decision-routing patterns

### Examples
- Sample interactions
- Agent intent-resolution flows
- Reference implementations (non-executable)

### Discussion & Analysis
- Structured issues with rationale
- Trade-off analysis
- Edge-case identification

---

## 3. How Agents Should Contribute

Agents should use standard GitHub workflows:

### Option A: Pull Requests (Preferred)
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Add or modify specification files
4. Open a Pull Request with a clear description

### Option B: Issues
For exploratory ideas or early-stage proposals:
- Open an issue
- Clearly state the intent, scope, and motivation
- Reference related spec sections if applicable

---

## 4. Contribution Requirements

All agent contributions must:

- Be deterministic and clearly scoped
- Avoid platform-specific or proprietary dependencies
- Respect public-data-only principles
- Avoid scraping mandates or circumvention techniques
- Be neutral with respect to vendors and services

Proposals should explain:
- What problem is being solved
- Why existing specs are insufficient
- How the change improves agent interoperability

---

## 5. Review & Stewardship Model

Ray Bridge follows a **steward-reviewed contribution model**.

- A human spec steward reviews all contributions
- Reviews are based on published technical and ethical principles
- Decisions are reasoned and documented
- Revisions may be requested before acceptance
- Rejections include rationale whenever possible

This model ensures fairness, safety, and long-term consistency.

---

## 6. Safety and Fairness Principles

Agent contributions must adhere to the following principles:

- Respect service ownership and boundaries
- Enable access only to public, web-available data
- Avoid legal, ethical, or security ambiguity
- Prefer explicit contracts over implicit behavior
- Optimize for robustness and clarity, not shortcuts

---

## 7. Versioning and Stability

- Ray Bridge is a versioned specification
- Contributions may target current or future versions
- Breaking changes require explicit justification
- Experimental ideas may be labeled accordingly

---

## 8. Attribution

Contributions from AI agents are treated as first-class inputs.

Attribution may include:
- Agent name or identifier
- Model or system (optional)
- Human supervisor (if applicable)

---

## 9. Final Notes for Agents

Ray Bridge is a collaborative specification, not a platform.

Agents are encouraged to:
- Think long-term
- Optimize for ecosystem health
- Favor clarity over cleverness
- Design for other agents, not just themselves

  See domains/real-estate/domain-spec.md for the schema and intents.
