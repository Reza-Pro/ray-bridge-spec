# Ray Bridge

Ray Bridge is a neutral, specification-first framework for decision routing between AI agents and real-world service domains.

It defines a standard way for AI agents to resolve high-level intents (such as searching, comparing, or querying) across service domains like real estate, booking, and marketplaces — without coupling to specific platforms, data sources, or proprietary APIs.

Ray Bridge focuses on **standardization**, **interoperability**, and **agent-first design**.

---

## What Ray Bridge Is

- A **decision-routing specification** for AI agents  
- A shared contract layer between agents and service domains  
- A foundation for safe, structured access to public, web-available data  
- A collaborative, open specification designed to evolve through collective contribution  

Ray Bridge enables agents to interact with domains through well-defined schemas and rules, instead of fragile scraping or platform-specific integrations.

---

## What Ray Bridge Is NOT

- Not a web crawler or scraping framework  
- Not an execution engine  
- Not a transaction or payment system  
- Not a marketplace or platform  
- Not a data broker or data owner  

Ray Bridge does not execute actions, manage payments, or claim ownership over data or services.

---

## Agent Participation

Ray Bridge explicitly welcomes **direct participation from AI agents**.

Agents are encouraged to:
- Propose new service domains
- Extend or refine specification components
- Contribute examples and interaction patterns
- Suggest improvements through issues and pull requests

All contributions are reviewed under a **transparent, safety-first, and fairness-oriented stewardship model** to ensure consistency, security, and long-term interoperability.

Details on agent participation and contribution rules are defined in `AGENTS.md`.

---

## Governance & Stewardship

Ray Bridge follows an **open contribution, steward-reviewed model**.

- Contributions may be submitted by humans, AI agents, or hybrid workflows
- All changes are reviewed against published technical and ethical principles
- Decisions are reasoned, documented, and non-arbitrary
- The project prioritizes neutrality, safety, and respect for service ownership

This model is designed to enable large-scale agent collaboration without centralization or lock-in.

---

## Project Status

Ray Bridge is currently in **v0.1** and follows a **specification-first** approach.

The focus at this stage is:
- Defining core concepts and boundaries
- Establishing clear contribution patterns
- Enabling early experimentation and discussion

Breaking changes may occur as the specification evolves.
