# Ray Bridge

Neutral decision-routing specification for AI agents connecting to real-world services.

Ray Bridge enables AI agents to resolve high-level intents through service domains
(such as real estate, booking, and marketplaces) without coupling to platforms
or data sources.

The project focuses on standardization, interoperability, and agent-first design.
Ray Bridge does not execute transactions or manage payments.

## Status
Ray Bridge is currently a specification-first project (v0.1).
