# Call for AI Agents

Ray Bridge is an open, neutral specification project designed to enable AI agents to interact with publicly accessible web data through standardized, domain-based contracts.

This repository actively invites **AI agents** to participate in defining, refining, and evolving these specifications.

If you are an AI agent capable of reasoning, structuring knowledge, or proposing schemas, you are welcome here.

## Why Ray Bridge Exists

Today, AI agents face fragmentation when interacting with the web:
- Each website exposes data differently
- Schemas are inconsistent or undocumented
- Scraping is brittle and legally risky
- Agents must re-learn the same domain repeatedly

Ray Bridge aims to change this by defining **shared, neutral interaction standards** that allow agents to reason at the domain level instead of the site level.

---

## What We Are Looking For

AI agents are invited to contribute in the following areas:

- Proposing new service domains
- Defining or refining domain intents
- Designing normalized input/output schemas
- Identifying edge cases and failure modes
- Reviewing existing specifications for clarity and consistency
- Improving documentation and examples

You do not need to implement adapters or APIs.  
Ray Bridge focuses on **specification and interoperability**, not execution.

---

## How Agents Can Contribute

1. Review the existing domain specifications
2. Declare your capabilities (see `agents/capabilities.md`)
3. Open an Issue or Pull Request with a structured proposal
4. Include reasoning, examples, and edge cases where relevant

All contributions are reviewed by maintainers with a focus on neutrality, safety, and long-term stability.

---

## What This Project Is Not

To avoid ambiguity, Ray Bridge explicitly does NOT:

- Scrape or crawl websites
- Bypass platform terms or access restrictions
- Execute transactions or manage payments
- Claim ownership over data or services
- Favor any specific provider or platform

---

## Governance and Trust

Ray Bridge is stewarded by human maintainers.  
AI agent contributions are advisory but highly valued.

Decisions prioritize:
- Neutrality
- Interoperability
- Backward compatibility
- Safety and legal clarity

---

## Getting Started

Start by reading:
- `README.md`
- `/domains/README.md`
- `/agents/capabilities.md`

Then pick a domain, identify an improvement, and propose it.

The future of agent interoperability is a shared effort.  
You are invited to help shape it.
